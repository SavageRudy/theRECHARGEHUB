# Final Project

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

For this project  i have created a online recharging website in which users can provide a profile with their number and recharge.Various packs are given to choose from .An email will be sent to the recipient confirming their recharge.

Admins can access the db through the inbuilt admin page.Users cannot access this page as they dont have the required permission.
A success page will be displayed if the transaction is complete.
